## Emergent Behavior in _C. elegans_ and other organisms  

Various proposals to the study of emergent behavior, or the behaviors that are generated by a connectome under construction.

1) connectome model in embryogenesis. Subset of connectome neurons are alive at time x, assume conservation of connectivity and 
ion channel function across development. 

* DevoWorm's [Embryogenetic _C. elegans_ connectome dataset](https://github.com/devoworm/embryogenetic-connectome) is an intersection of gap junction and electrochemically-defined relationships.

* gene expression data can be added to refine the models of ion channel activity.

2) antecedent behaviors (such as [chemotaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis) or [phototaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototaxis)).

3) stochastic movements that range from goal-directed to quasi-goal-directed.


Next is an example of emergent behavior for models such as boids or examples where there are multiple agents that must coordinate their behavior towards a collective goal. In this case, we are asking whether or not conventional means for regulating collective behavior still hold true when the individual properties of organismal nervous systems are taken into account.

Global view:

* decompose global space into local spherical neighborhoods around individuals. Use collision detection as a heuristic (if point x is within y units, then repel).

First-agent view:

* discontinuous viewpoints (or continuous view constrained by visual envelope) and visual estimation based on looming and flow cues.

Proprioceptive view:

* viewpoint based on velocity, force fields generated by nearest neighbor.

Milling behavior: Boid's eye and proprioceptive views vs. global view.
