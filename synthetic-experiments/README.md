1) analysis of oscillations: perodicity, attractor analysis. 

Delahunt, C.B. and Kutz, J.N. (2019). [Putting a bug in ML: The moth olfactory network learns to read MNIST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05405). _arXiv_, 1802.05405.

2) animat simulation: plug in movement data (into virtual environment). Can we model adaptive responses?

3) "real" vs. "fake" behavior? Behavioral Turing tests.

* Gillespie algorithm, Markov jump process, generic Monte Carlo simulation.
